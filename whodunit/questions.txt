1.  stint.h is a header file which consists of numerous typedef's that specify the custom made integer values in the file.

2.  These enable the programmer to utilize the exact and precize amount of space needed in a file.

3.  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes

4.  BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER are the two header files.

5.  bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file whereas biSize is the number of bytes in the info-header.

6.  If the biHeight is negative, then the bitmap is a top-botton DIB and its origin is at the top-left.

7.  The biBitCount specifies the BMP's bits per colour.

8.  The function fopen may return NULL in the specified lines in the code because the function will not be able to find a file.

9.  This is so because the programmer only wants to copy one individual strucutre at a time.

10. ( 4 - (3*3) % 4) % 4 iss equal to 3.

11. The fseek function allows the programmer to move to a specified location within the file. Analogy - like rewinding/ fast forwarding in a DVD player.

12. It indicates the current position of the position pointer.
